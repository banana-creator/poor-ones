# A simple poor-ones textadventure-game-engine in python

At school, my child had the task of writing a small text adventure in Python. Of course, there was no object-oriented programming to begin with. It was about consolidating basic knowledge. He had great fun with it.

From this, the idea of a small game engine emerged.

There are places between which you can walk back and forth. Objects are added to the places. Small functions are attached to them. These functions represent the interaction and the story you want to tell.

Items can also be collected and used to create new ones (crafting).

So, you should only know about basic stuff like lists, dictionaries, for and while loops, if and else...

Just have a look at the example, read the comments and then use the empty template for your own little adventures.

Have fun!
